# Balancing Limbo

This project was manufactured with React, JSX, (Bulma.io CSS, NES.css) frameworks, external iframes and a lot of fun content to work with, and browse through. 


## What is it?
This project is a multi-media platform that replicates a gameboy emulator. 
TO GET TO HOME SCREEN: Press power button on gameboy IMG. 

- It contains three libraries of curated cartoons, games, and funny commercial-quotes styled as magic 8 ball answers. 
- A user can browse through and play cartoons, games, and commercials.  
- An admin can perform CRUD actions through the admin menu. 
	- To travel to there, click the lock button in the corner of the home screen.

	The admin controls are public access (not password protected) at the moment due to out-of-reach tech.

### A snippet speaking on our new tech we used for our react+ruby web app: 
We discovered ways to display games from websites hosting independently-made games, using their web embedded iframe links, itch.io, and independent streaming websites such as bumpworthy.com, and kimcartoons.to, to fulfill our libraries. 
<br/>
Balancing Limbo presents as an interesting, stylish platform, to play mini games, watch cartoons, and see random commercials, in such a style that is perfected for the average, bored and nostalgic-loving, burnt-out coder.

## `Our Three Stretch Goals `
<p>1. Getting all of our libraries to successfully interact with the iframes</p>
<p>2. Having our app scale with the browser window</p>
<p>3. Getting our CRUD to successfully run.</p>
