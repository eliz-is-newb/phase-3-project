# Balancing Limbo

This project was manufactured with React, JSX, (Bulma.io CSS, NES.css) frameworks, external iframes and a lot of fun content to work with, and browse through. 


## What is it?
This project is a multi-media platform that replicates a gameboy emulator. 
- It contains three libraries of curated cartoons, games, and funny commercial-quotes styled as magic 8 ball answers. 
- A user can browse through and play cartoons, games, and commercials.  
- An admin can perform CRUD actions through the use of the password, "unicorns", by clicking on this button, </

	 , to view, add, edit, or delete entries in any of the libraries available. 

### A snippet from our about react app: 
We discovered ways to display games from websites hosting independently-made games, using their web embedded iframe links, itch.io, and independent streaming websites such as bumpworthy.com, and kimcartoons.to, to fulfill our libraries. To access these links for any other admin, a tutorial for how to use inspect on these specific pages would be required. 
Balancing Limbo presents as an interesting, stylish platform, to play mini games, watch cartoons, and see random quotes as answers to our random, everyday questions, in such a way that is perfected for the average, bored, nostalgic-loving, burnt-out coder.

### `Our Three Stretch Goals `
<p>1. Getting all of our libraries to successfully interact with the iframes</p>
<p>2. Having our app scale with the browser window</p>
<p>3. Finishing in time with the deadline.</p>
